Hence, spatial policy for rural areas often focuses on the provision of key services of general interest in areas experiencing population decline. However, the actual changes in distribution and accessibility of several services are almost never evaluated longitudinally, and most recent studies focus on measuring access in terms of supply and demand using aggregated data. This paper offers an alternative method, from an equality standpoint, and investigates changes in access and distribution of local facilities for basic needs (food, education and health care) in Frysla^n (Netherlands). By doing so, it questions the focus of Dutch spatial policy on depopulating areas. Changes in access to primary schools, general practitioners and supermarkets between 2000 and 2012 are visualised by overlapping network analyses in GIS. The results are discussed in the context of depopulation and the decline of local facilities from smaller towns and villages. This paper concludes that due to the initial high density of basic facilities the accessibility remained quite good. Moreover, major changes in access do not coincide with the areas targeted by the government to deal with effects of population decline. This suggests that spatial policy for facility-decline should focus on people with low mobility in small villages throughout Frysla^n, rather than depopulating areas. This research shows the importance of questioning the assumptions behind spatial policy for service-provision, and offers a simple method to do so.}, journal={Applied Geography}, author={Christiaanse, Suzan}, year={2020}, month={Aug}, pages={102251} }

In order to achieve this goal, the potential quotient index has been used, taking into account both the demand for educational services operationalised with the population aged 15–19, and the supply of services depicted by the supply of places for pupils in different types of upper secondary school. A supplementary objective is to present recommendations for transport and educational policy implemented in the city in the context of potential locations of new upper secondary schools based on, among other parameters, the mean centre of the potential accessibility distribution and the potential accessibility dispersion index. We conclude that to better balance access to different types of schools throughout the city in the future, a new location for a general upper secondary school could be considered in the southern or eastern parts of Kraków.}, number={1}, journal={Moravian Geographical Reports}, author={Rosik, Piotr and Puławska-Obiedowska, Sabina and Goliszek, Sławomir}, year={2021}, month={Mar}, pages={15–26} }

The effects of consolidation on the educational quality and the economies of scale have been well researched; but studies on the commuting distance are limited in scope because they usually rely on comparing distances pre- and post-consolidation—which may exaggerate the consolidation’s effect. In this study, optimization approaches are used to decompose school commuting distances at Yanqing, Beijing, based on survey data. The costs of long-distance school commuting as a result of consolidation are estimated after decomposing the effects of school districting, school location and financial stimulation. The findings indicate that these factors contribute significantly to pupils’ long travel distance, and the negative effect of consolidation on school size standardization is exaggerated. These results imply that long-distance school commuting should not be the rationale for a suspension of the central government’s consolidation policy.}, number={2}, journal={Applied Spatial Analysis and Policy}, author={Dai, Te-qi and Wang, Liang and Zhang, Yu-chao and Liao, Cong and Liu, Zheng-bing}, year={2019}, month={Jun}, pages={191–204} }

  abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings: Transportation equity research addresses questions of participation and planning process or the distribution of transportation’s benefits and burdens. This work largely elides issues related to youth and student travel. Existing work on school trip mode choice does not engage deeply with the equity implications of its findings. Education equity researchers identify the abstract notion of choice as equity enhancing but do not engage with the realities of disparate transportation resources and infrastructure. In this review essay, we articulate the contours of transportation equity, youth travel, and school choice research. We use emerging perspectives on “mobility justice” to frame the issues and provide vocabulary that can help bring education and transportation together in planners’ everyday work. Takeaway for practice: A mobility justice framework encourages critical thought and action to address the root causes of inequities. Our conclusions make three contributions to research and practice: 1) challenging school district leaders to think about choice systems designed for access to schools, not just access to information about available options; 2) clarifying the broader implications of school choice by refusing to look away from the racial implications of forecasts; and 3) elucidating the need for a regional perspective.},

The floating catchment area (FCA) method defines the service area of physicians by a threshold travel time while accounting for the availability of physicians by their surrounded demands. The gravity-based method considers a nearby physician more accessible than a remote one and discounts a physician's availability by a gravity-based potential. The former is a special case of the latter. Based on the 2000 Census and primary care physician data, this research assesses the variation of spatial accessibility to primary care in the Chicago region, and analyzes the sensitivity of results by experimenting with ranges of threshold travel times in the FCA method and travel friction coefficients in the gravity model. The methods may be used to help the US Department of Health and Human Services and state health departments improve designation of Health Professional Shortage Areas.},

In this paper a refined methodological framework for measuring accessibility is presented, which enables the researcher (1) to improve the measurement by accounting for job competition among workers commuting by different modes, and (2) to understand the outcome more thoroughly by distinguishing the effect of location from that of workers' auto ownership. This refined framework is applied to a case study of employment accessibility of low-wage workers living in Boston's inner-city neighborhoods, with primarily 1990 Census demographic and journey-to-work data. The empirical results show clearly that, although the central location of inner-city residence still gives the low-wage workers some advantage, auto ownership is the more important determinant. Low-wage workers living in inner-city neighborhoods on average do not have high employment accessibility because a large percentage of them do not own any motor vehicle and hence have limited spatial mobility. Implications of the findings are discussed and qualified in light of the limitation of the research.},

We simulate the Well-to-Wheel energy consumption and GHG emissions of eight transit buses and passenger car powertrains. Vehicles are simulated under three generalized North American operating contexts (450 operating scenarios) using Autonomie and the GREET database. All technologies are normalized by passenger-service-mode-trip-km-travelled GHG emissions to facilitate equivalent comparison. The results indicate that all simulated mobility solutions carry a large variability; however, the most environmentally competitive solutions are fuel cell electric car-share, battery electric car-share, and battery-electric bus, all powered by low-carbon intensity power sources at average occupancy (0.23–19.7 g CO2e passenger-service-mode-trip-km-travelled-1). Furthermore, transit bus technologies have the potential to reduce up to 2.3 times more GHG per passenger-trip than comparable ride-share technologies. Overall, this paper defines occupancy GHG emission thresholds for mobility solutions to inform environmental decision-making processes.},

	abstract = {One of the most common applications of accessibility is in evaluating inequality in access to jobs. A vital factor to be incorporated by accessibility indicators when analyzing job accessibility is the competition for job positions by job seekers; otherwise, the results may be inaccurate or misleading. Despite efforts by researchers to develop accessibility measures that capture job competition, they fail to ensure that these measures are practical and easily interpretable and communicable, which in turn makes planners and policymakers continue to opt for more straightforward measures. In this paper we aim to fill this gap by providing a simple accessibility measure that accounts for competition effects, while remaining practical, intuitive, and highly communicable. The proposed indicator – Balancing Time – is applied to assess the inequality in job accessibility in 160 neighborhoods within the city of Rio de Janeiro, and the results are compared with the most popular indicator used in practice, the cumulative opportunities. The findings suggest that Balancing Time overcomes some of the limitations of cumulative opportunities and that it is a useful tool for planners, particularly in the cities with job opportunities concentrated in central areas. Given its simplicity, Balancing Time is especially relevant in the context of the Global South, where most transport agencies face data limitations and have low skilled technical staff.},

The analysis of research results in the field of mass transit reveals an explicit similarity between {TLD} in different cities and the gamma distribution. It points to general regularities in various systems of mass transit that lead to the similarity in {TLD}. The regularities are determined by studying the spatial distribution of mass transit stops, which are considered trip origins and destinations.

   abstract = {As accessibility becomes an increasingly relevant concept in the analysis of sustainable transport and urban development, the accuracy of accessibility measures becomes increasingly vital. While more complex measures are gradually gaining popularity with increasing data and computational resources, policy makers and planners are still prone to opt for less complex methods that are easy to use and interpret. The cumulative opportunities measure is the most widely applied accessibility measure in planning practice, but it is also among the least accurate due to its lack of consideration of the impact of competition for those opportunities. This study seeks to highlight the impact of addressing competition for different urban services in the cumulative opportunities measure. A competition component is added to the measure, which is applied to a case study of three types of urban services in the Perth metropolitan area; health, primary/secondary education and shopping. The results show that considering competition changes the spatial patterns of accessibility and its equity. Since this approach reveals demand-supply imbalances, it can more accurately determine spatial inequalities in accessibility, and hence increases the utility of the cumulative opportunities measure. We also find that the three services had varying levels and spatial patterns of accessibility and spatial equity, thus relying on any single one of them for assessing spatial structural performance can be misleading.},

	abstract = {Conventional integral measures of accessibility, although valuable as indicators of place accessibility, have several limitations when used to evaluate individual accessibility. Two alternatives for overcoming some of the difficulties involved are explored in this study. One is to adapt these measures for evaluating individual accessibility using a disaggregate, nonzonal approach. The other is to develop different types of measures based on an alternative conceptual framework. To pursue the former alternative, this study specifies and examines eighteen gravity-type and cumulative-opportunity accessibility measures using a point-based spatial framework. For the latter option, twelve space-time accessibility measures are developed based on the construct of a prism-constrained feasible opportunity set. This paper compares the relationships and spatial patterns of these thirty measures using network-based GIS procedures. Travel diary data collected in Columbus, Ohio, and a digital data set of 10,727 selected land parcels are used for all computation. Results of this study indicate that space-time and integral indices are distinctive types of accessibility measures which reflect different dimensions of the accessibility experience of individuals. Since space-time measures are more capable of capturing interpersonal differences, especially the effect of space-time constraints, they are more “gender sensitive” and helpful for unraveling gender/ethnic differences in accessibility. An important methodological implication is that whether accessibility is observed to be important or different between individuals depends heavily on whether the measure used is capable of revealing the kind of differences the analyst intends to observe.},

   abstract = {Accessibility is a concept of continuing relevance in transportation research. A number of different measures of accessibility, defined as the potential to reach spatially dispersed opportunities, have been proposed in the literature, and used to address various substantive planning and policy questions. Our objective in this paper is to conduct a review of various commonly used measures of accessibility, with a particular view to clarifying their normative (i.e. prescriptive), as well as positive (i.e. descriptive) aspects. This is a distinction that has seldom been made in the literature and that helps to better understand the meaning of alternative ways to implement the concept of accessibility. Our discussion of the positive and normative aspects of accessibility measurements is illustrated using the city of Montreal, Canada, as a case study. The example highlights the differences in the measured levels of accessibility depending on implementation. Comparison of the two by means of a relative indicator of accessibility helps to identify the gap between desired (as normative defined) and actual (as revealed) accessibility levels.

	abstract = {The evaluation of social impacts of transport policies has been attracting growing attention in recent years. Yet studies thus far have predominately focused on developed countries and overlooked whether equity assessment of transport projects is sensitive to the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). This paper investigates how investments in public transport can reshape socio-spatial inequalities in access to opportunities, and it examines how MAUP can influence the distributional effects of transport project evaluations. The study looks at Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and the transformations carried out in the city in preparation for the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics, which involved substantial expansion in public transport infrastructure followed by cuts in service levels. The paper uses before-and-after comparison of Rio's transport network (2014-2017) and quasi-counterfactual analysis to examine how those policies affect access to schools and jobs for different income groups and whether the results are robust when the data is analyzed at different spatial scales and zoning schemes. Results show that subsequent cuts in service levels have offset the accessibility benefits of transport investments in a way that particularly penalizes the poor, and that those investments alone would still have generated larger accessibility gains for higher-income groups. These findings suggest that, contrary to Brazil’s official discourse of transport legacy, recent policies in Rio have exacerbated rather than reduced socio-spatial inequalities in access to opportunities. The study also shows that MAUP can influence the equity assessment of transport projects, suggesting that this issue should be addressed in future research.},

	abstract = {Accessibility plays a fundamental role in the transport network. In fact, accessibility may be used for investigating the (un)even distribution of economic activities, or the (dis)equilibrium in the development of different regional performances. In particular, accessibility analysis can be considered as a first exploratory step in the understanding of people's needs and behaviour, especially in the framework of transport network structures. From the methodological viewpoint, accessibility has a long tradition, starting in the 1950's with the pioneering work by Hansen, who defined accessibility as the potential of opportunity for interaction. Such a definition can also be considered as an integrated framework of all subsequent definitions. The aim of this paper is to explore accessibility in the German commuting network, by focusing attention on the relevance of the impedance form associated with it. The conventional (potential) accessibility function - in the light of the related economic activities - is used as a suitable instrument to identify the major German hub/attraction nodes. In this formulation, different types of decay functions are used as impedance forms. In our applications we consider home-to-work commuters travelling between 439 German districts, for both 2003 and 2007. We carry out a comparative analysis of the accessibility values in these years, by outlining the different emerging hierarchies, resulting from the use of different impedance forms. In addition, we explore which type of accessibility indicator best matches the connectivity network. The final aim is to identify - by means of different accessibility functions - homogeneous vs. heterogeneous characteristics of the German commuting network.},

Measuring the spatial accessibility to urban parks serves as an initial step in urban planning and devel­ oping urban development strategies to improve social and environmental justice. This study aims to evaluate measures of spatial accessibility to urban parks by comparing three geographic information systems (GIS)-based approaches, accounting for network complexity, transport modes, distance thresholds, and destination choices. Taking Ipswich City (Australia) and Enschede (the Netherlands) as two testbeds, we examine the spatial patterns of a total of 21 accessibility measures in the two cities and conduct a correlation and principal component analysis to unravel the interrelationship between these measures. The results suggest that among all measures under the three approaches, the selection of distance thresholds and transport modes matter more to accessibility measures than the destination choices. Furthermore, when distance threshold and transport mode are held constant, the network-based and entrance-based methods provide more realistic accessibility measures than other methods. We also discuss the generality of the entrance-based method we propose and suggest ways to choose the most appropriate accessibility measure for use in different contexts.},

  abstract = {Low-carbon travel of urban residents is an important issue of public concern for sustainable development of global cities under climate change. The carbon emissions generated by school trips occupy a significant pro­ portion of the carbon emissions of people’s travel and are increasing year by year. In this paper, we review the progress in research on carbon emissions generated by school trips, the socio-spatial differences in school trips, and the influence mechanisms and optimization simulations of carbon emissions from school trips. Two major dilemmas are observed in the human-environment relationship of low-carbon school trips. First, the dramatic reconstruction of social space in cities and the imbalanced development of public service supply in the rapid urbanization process have led to the socio-spatial heterogeneity of the complex environment of school trips, thus making it difficult to form an effective model of governance of urban space that is conducive to low-carbon school trips. Second, the interaction mechanisms related to school trips remain unclear due to the dynamic and multi-scale nature of the geographic environment, which hinders a clear description of the effects of the built environment on low-carbon school trips and the in-depth simulation of the optimization path. Therefore, in future research, researchers should focus on multi-paradigm crossover and fusion, carry out prospective explo­ ration on the human-environment interactions associated with low-carbon school trips, enrich the research methods of human-environment relationship, discuss the mechanisms of the complete built environment on lowcarbon school trips, simulate the spatial nested structure and refine the governance model to meet the needs for low-carbon school trips.},

	abstract = {Due to a change in capital funding formula, many school boards across the Province of Ontario engaged in Accommodation Reviews to rationalize the supply of school capacity. This process led to numerous school closures and raised important policy questions regarding the economic value of a school in terms of its capitalization into property values and, by extension, how the closure of a school might affect local neighborhoods. To explore these questions, this research uses spatial hedonic methods to estimate the implicit value of accessibility to schools in the City of Hamilton, Ontario. Spatial Durbin model results provide evidence of a significant negative correlation between distance to schools and housing prices in the Canadian context. This suggests that accessibility to schools is capitalized into property values and that the closure of a neighborhood school may result in potentially significant losses of economic value in communities.},

	abstract = {The location choices of households with children connect housing, labor, and school markets. These connections may shape the city structure, access to opportunities and the outcome of policies addressing each market separately. To study the consequences of these connections, I develop a quantitative spatial model that incorporates school choice. Parents with diﬀerent skills select their residence by balancing access to schools and employment, choose a school considering its endogenous peer composition, and compete with childless households for houses and jobs. I use data from Madrid on school admissions and workers’ commuting trips to estimate preferences for schools and workplaces. Combining households’ location data with exogenous variation from the city’s historical expansion, I estimate neighborhood preferences separately from endogenous school quality. I ﬁnd that school access inﬂuences residential and job choices, decreasing segregation across parents by 15\% and shifting workers towards productive areas. However, the opposite relocation of non-parents increases overall segregation. Work commuting costs concentrate skilled households in central locations, increasing school quality diﬀerences for students from high and low-skill families by 2.6\% through peer eﬀects. Finally, I show that interactions between schools and the labor market shape the eﬀects of work-from-home and school transportation policies.},

	abstract = {Car use for commuting to school is responsible of a significant amount of {CO}2 emissions, negatively impacting on climate change and calling for action. We collected 8,343 responses through an online survey before the Covid19 pandemic (November/December 2019) from a sample of schools located in the province of Varese (Northwest of Italy). First, the study estimates the home-school commuting {CO}2 emissions from students and school staff of the selected schools, both in the starting scenario and in policy scenarios, inducing different potential shifts from car towards more sustainable transport means. Second, it determines the most relevant factors of transport mode selection for school commuting. The findings show that students at high school, even if their trips are generally longer, have lower {CO}2 emissions than teachers/staff and students of primary and middle schools, because of a higher intensive use of public transport. The optimistic scenario of a 75\% shift from car use to walking, for homeschool distances up to 2 km, and to public transport, for distances between 2 and 10 km, would save a big amount of {CO}2 emissions, included in the range 60–67\%. Travel distance and time are the two most relevant factors, when students and teachers/staff select the transport means for school commuting. The identification of appropriate sustainable transport policies should consider the geographical, urban, and infrastructural charac­ teristics of the place in which each school is located and of the travel routes.},

	abstract = {Place-based accessibility measures communicate the potential interaction with opportunities at a zone that populations can access. Recent research has explored the implications of how opportunities are counted by different accessibility methods. In conventional measures, opportunities are multiply counted if more than one zone offers access to the same opportunity. This multi-count of opportunities leads to values of accessibility that are difficult to interpret. A possible solution to enhance the meaning-making of accessibility results is by constraining the calculations to match a known quantity. This ensures all zonal values sum up to a predetermined quantity (i.e., the total number of opportunities). In this way, each value can be meaningfully related to this total. A recent effort that implements this solution is spatial availability, a singly-constrained accessibility measure. In this paper, we extend spatial availability for use in the case of multiple modes or more generally, heterogeneous population segments with distinct travel behaviors. After deriving a multimodal version of spatial availability, we proceed to illustrate its features using a synthetic example. We then apply it to an empirical example of low emission zones in Madrid, Spain. We conclude with suggestions for future research and its use in evaluating policy interventions.},
