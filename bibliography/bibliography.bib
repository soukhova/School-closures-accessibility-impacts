This study models the impacts of household transportation resources on two education related outcomes: after-school activity participation and attendance at a non-local high school. We model after-school activity participation across the Greater Toronto Area through probit regression, identifying a signiﬁcant eﬀect of public transit accessibility on a high school student’s likelihood of participating in an after-school activity. We conduct a similar analysis predicting the likelihood that a student attends a non-local high school in the City of Toronto, wherein over 60\% of students attend one of several alternatives to local designated high schools. Finally, we conduct a biprobit Seemingly Unrelated Regression ({SUR}) on both variables to account for unobserved student and household characteristics that inﬂuence both outcomes. Our results highlight a signiﬁcantly positive association between transit accessibility and students’ participation in after-school activities. We identify a weakly signiﬁcant association between transit accessibility and attending non-local schools. We contend that while transportation resources may not be the most signiﬁcant factors inﬂuencing these outcomes, transportation plays a signiﬁcant enough role in students’ lives to warrant thoughtful attention by policymakers.},

The results show that the students experienced 18 main barriers in using the bus. The limited time of travel, circuitous routes, and distance to the bus stops were the three most significant barriers for students in using the bus during the morning commute. Conversely, students reported no difficulty using the bus regarding safety and payment system aspects. This result additionally shows that gender, age, allowance, and drivers' licenses also influence the extent of the barrier experienced by the students. Finally, some strategies to increase the students' ability to overcome barriers in utilizing the bus are proposed to create a sustainable public transport system in Yogyakarta.},

This study examines the relationships between {NE} and utilitarian walking among older vs. younger adults living in {US} rural towns.
Methods: Data for this cross-sectional study came from telephone interviews in 2011-2012 with 2,140 randomly sampled younger (18-64 years, n = 1,398) and older (65+ years, n = 742) adults, collecting personal and {NE} perception variables. {NE} around each participant's home was also measured objectively using geographic information system techniques. Separate mixed-effects logistic regression models were estimated for the two age groups, predicting the odds of utilitarian walking at least once a week.
Results: Perceived presence of crosswalks and pedestrian signals was significantly related to utilitarian walking in both age groups. Among older adults, unattended dogs, lighting at night, and religious institutions were positively while steep slope was negatively associated with their walking. For younger adults, traffic speed (negative, -), public transportation (positive, +), malls (-), cultural/recreational destinations (+), schools (+), and resource production land uses such as farms and mines (-) were significant correlates of utilitarian walking.
Conclusion: Different characteristics of {NE} are associated with utilitarian walking among younger vs. older adults in {US} rural towns. Optimal modifications of {NE} to promote walking may need to reflect these age differences.},

Methods. The Raising healthy Eating and Active Living in Alberta ({REAL} Kids Alberta) study is a population-based health survey among Grade 5 students. In 2009, physical activity levels were measured using time-stamped pedometers (number of steps/hour) among 688 children. Parents reported mode of transportation to and from school ({AT}/non-{AT}). Multilevel multiple linear regression analyses with corresponding β coefﬁcients were conducted to quantify the relationship between mode of transportation to and from school with (1) overall step count, and (2) the likelihood of achieving at least 13,500 steps per day recommended for optimal growth and development.
Results. Among urban children, those who used {AT} to and from school accumulated more steps [β = 1124(95\% {CI} = 170,2077)] and although not signiﬁcant, were more likely to achieve the recommended 13,500 steps/day compared to those not using {AT} to and from school [{OR} = 1.61(95\% {CI} = 0.93,2.81)].
Conclusion. Using {AT} to and from school appears to be beneﬁcial to children by supplementing their physical activity, particularly those living in urban regions. Strategies to promote physical activity are needed, particular for children residing in rural regions and smaller towns.},

	abstract = {Background
Adolescents perceive different barriers for walking versus cycling to school. This study examined whether adolescents’ perceptions of walking and cycling differ by home-to-school distance.
Methods
Adolescents (n = 1,401; age: 15.1 ± 1.4 years; 55.1\% females) completed an online survey about their school travel and perceptions of walking and cycling to school in Dunedin, New Zealand. Based on home-to-school distance, adolescents were categorised into three groups: ‘walkable’ (≤2.25 km; n = 455), ‘cyclable’ ({\textgreater}2.25-≤4.0 km; n = 286) and ‘beyond cyclable’ distance ({\textgreater}4.0 km; n = 660).
Results
Rates of active transport to school decreased with increasing distance (‘walkable’/‘cyclable’/‘beyond cyclable’: 60.1\%/16.4\%/1.2\%; p{\textless}0.001). For walking to school, attitudes (experiential and instrumental beliefs), subjective norms and behavioural intentions decreased with increasing distance (all p{\textless}0.001) whereas perceived behavioural control did not change significantly. For cycling to school, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control decreased (all p{\textless}0.001) whereas experiential and instrumental beliefs and behavioural intentions were not different across the distance groups. As home-to-school distance increased, self-efficacy for both walking and cycling to school decreased whereas personal and environmental barriers, safety-related concerns and convenience of driving for trip chaining increased (all p{\textless}0.001). Absence of cycle lanes and low interest in cycling were consistent barriers across distance categories.
Conclusions
Adolescents’ perceptions of walking and cycling to school differ based on home-to-school distance. Thus, distance to school needs to be accounted for in active transport to school initiatives, and walking- and cycling-specific barriers tackled.},

	abstract = {The rapid spread of {COVID}-19 across the world has raised concerns about the responsiveness of cities and healthcare systems during pandemics. Recent studies try to model how the number of {COVID}-19 infections will likely grow and impact the demand for hospitalization services at national and regional levels. However, less attention has been paid to the geographic access to {COVID}-19 healthcare services and to hospitals’ response capacity at the local level, particularly in urban areas in the Global South. This paper shows how transport accessibility analysis can provide actionable information to help improve healthcare coverage and responsive­ ness. It analyzes accessibility to {COVID}-19 healthcare at high spatial resolution in the 20 largest cities of Brazil. Using network-distance metrics, we estimate the vulnerable population living in areas with poor access to healthcare facilities that could either screen or hospitalize {COVID}-19 patients. We then use a new balanced floating catchment area ({BFCA}) indicator to estimate spatial, income, and racial inequalities in access to hospitals with intensive care unit ({ICU}) beds and mechanical ventilators while taking into account congestion effects. Based on this analysis, we identify substantial social and spatial inequalities in access to health services during the pandemic. The availability of {ICU} equipment varies considerably between cities, and it is substantially lower among black and poor communities. The study maps territorial inequalities in healthcare access and reflects on different policy lessons that can be learned for other countries based on the Brazilian case.},

	abstract = {A healthy food environment is an important component in helping people access and maintain healthy diets, which may reduce the prevalence of chronic disease. With few exceptions, studies on healthy food access in urban regions typically ignore how time of day impacts access to food. Similarly, most extant research ignores the complexities of accounting for the role of transportation in spatial access. Examining healthy food access is important, especially for populations whose day-to-day schedules do not align with a typical work schedule. This study proﬁles novel methods that can be used to examine the daily dynamics of food access in Toronto, Ontario, using grocery stores as a case study to examine the changing geographies of food access over a 24-h period, and the impact of a changing public transit schedule on food access. Walking and automobile travel times are also reported. Results indicate that access to grocery stores is severely diminished for large parts of the city in the late night and early morning, and that public transit travel times are higher and more variable in the early morning hours. Ultimately, this research demonstrates the need for further study on how residents with nonconventional schedules experience, and are affected by, the dynamic food and transportation environments. Future research should build upon the methods presented here to include a broader range of food retailers.},

	abstract = {Several cities around the world have changed their transportation planning paradigm, understanding that the prime goal is to provide access to opportunities for everyone. To address this goal, public transport plays a fundamental role and, therefore, it is key for developing a sustainable and equitable city.
This paper proposes a methodology to analyze access to opportunities through public transport incorporating the user's valuation of attributes that impact the level of service on his/her trip and the competitiveness for urban opportunities. Using data from Santiago, Chile, we applied the proposed methodology to analyze accessibility to higher-quality public primary schools. We compare total travel time ({TTT}) with a proposed measure of total generalized travel time ({TGTT}) using simple potential and competitive accessibility indicators, accounting for the subjective valuation of walking time, travel time, waiting time, comfort and transfers, and translating them into in-vehicle time units.
We find that the inclusion of competition has a more substantial impact than including the subjective valuation of the level of service in the accessibility to educational opportunities. Using competitive measures with {TGTT}, we found that around 20\% of the zones in Santiago have at least a 50\% deficit of higher-quality public education, and 71\% of them are in peripheral areas. Furthermore, these zones, where medium and low-income population usually lives, can experience, on average, 1-2 transfers, 4-5 passengers per square meter, and 15-min waiting. We conclude that the proposed methodology provides a more comprehensive way to understand accessibility by incorporating the traveling experience, allowing to determine how and where to intervene to effectively improve accessibility, with a focus on urban equity.},

	abstract = {Mapping job accessibility and sociospatial inequalities is a crucial task to support the design and evaluation of public policies and services. Although the concept of accessibility encompasses similar dimensions across studies, which involve the interaction between transport systems and land use, its implementation varies substantially depending on the research or policy need, mode of transport, and data availability. In this paper, we employ the optimization-based accessibility metric, adapted from the optimum accessibility landscapes measure, to the analysis of the accessibility and availability of public services that are essential to everyday mobility in the cities of Sa˜o Paulo and Curitiba, in Brazil. Since it simultaneously captures supply and demand as endogenous variables in an optimization algorithm, without losing communicability, we argue that the metric may be particularly useful to public policies that involve decisions at multiple territorial scales and government levels, such as schools, healthcare facilities, and greenspaces. By identifying locations with no access to public services due to lack of proximity and service capacity, locations with low access to public services due to long distances and spatial barriers, and locations with access to poor quality services, it is possible to better inform the formulation and prioritization of public policies aiming at reducing inequalities in everyday mobility, with differential effects according to social class, race, and gender.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the issue of the permanent closures of public schools in Ontario. School closure processes are highly (and bitterly) contested, rife with conflict, and with few exceptions, harshly criticized by school and community stakeholders who see closures as a loss of irreplaceable social infrastructure. There is a need for a more nuanced planning style that acknowledges the realities of politics, unequal power relations and the validity of community residents' needs and values.To better understand the consequences of school closures upon communities, the authors evaluate the historical and current school closure decision-making process in Ontario. This entails a four part approach: understanding the role that schools play and the impacts of closure, especially on inner-city communities; examining the reasons for closures; exploring the closure process itself, comparing and contrasting process intent with application experiences; and, identifying alternatives to existing school-closures decision-making processes and framework.

Hence, spatial policy for rural areas often focuses on the provision of key services of general interest in areas experiencing population decline. However, the actual changes in distribution and accessibility of several services are almost never evaluated longitudinally, and most recent studies focus on measuring access in terms of supply and demand using aggregated data. This paper offers an alternative method, from an equality standpoint, and investigates changes in access and distribution of local facilities for basic needs (food, education and health care) in Frysla^n (Netherlands). By doing so, it questions the focus of Dutch spatial policy on depopulating areas. Changes in access to primary schools, general practitioners and supermarkets between 2000 and 2012 are visualised by overlapping network analyses in GIS. The results are discussed in the context of depopulation and the decline of local facilities from smaller towns and villages. This paper concludes that due to the initial high density of basic facilities the accessibility remained quite good. Moreover, major changes in access do not coincide with the areas targeted by the government to deal with effects of population decline. This suggests that spatial policy for facility-decline should focus on people with low mobility in small villages throughout Frysla^n, rather than depopulating areas.

For this purpose, detailed information on travel behavior gathered through large-scale travel surveys conducted in the greater Montreal, Quebec, Canada, area was used. The travel behavior observed in recent travel surveys was analyzed to estimate the number of short trips for various population segments. These surveys gathered travel and sociodemographic information for approximately 5\% of the population. Data from the 2003 survey revealed that more than 7 million motorized trips were made during a typical weekday; 862,000 (11.7\%) were shorter than 1.6 km (1 mi). With the appropriate speed and stride for each population segment, these motorized kilometers were converted into numbers of steps to appraise the potential physical activity benefits of making these short trips by foot instead of by a motorized mode. The results show that about 837,000 motorized kilometers could be converted into almost 1,156 million steps every day. Overall, 12.5\% of the population had steps in reserve, an average of 2,660 steps per person. Such a shift in mode choice could help some people meet their required physical activity volumes through their daily travel patterns while helping to save energy, reduce pollution, and mitigate traffic congestion.},

  abstract = {"Steps in reserve" are the steps that people could take but do not take because they choose to travel by using a motorized mode for short trips instead of walking. Many studies have already confirmed that the potential to walk is important and that a shift from motorized mode to walking for short trips could be beneficial to many people from a physical activity perspective. The current research is an extension of this study of latent walk trips and proposes a comparison of steps in reserve in two large Canadian metropolitan areas-Montreal, Quebec, and Toronto, Ontario-for various population segments and neighborhood densities. It also adds measures of how these steps in reserve have evolved over time and discusses whether current travel behaviors have been influenced by ever-increasing promotional campaigns to be more active. The research relies on rich sources of microdata on daily travel behaviors; data from four large-scale origin-destination travel surveys (1998 and 2003 for the Montreal area and 1996 and 2001 for the Toronto area) are processed in order to estimate the impacts of a theoretical mode shift scenario on the number of steps people could add to their volume of physical activity on a daily basis. Results show that steps in reserve are quite consistent across metropolitan areas. Around 15\% of the population have steps in reserve, an average of 2,430 steps per day. Moreover, the estimated models confirm that both the propensity to have steps in reserve and the number of steps in reserve vary according to individual, household, and neighborhood features. For instance, living alone and owning a driver's license will increase the probability of having steps in reserve, whereas being a full-time worker decreases the average number of steps in reserve per day.}

The effects of consolidation on the educational quality and the economies of scale have been well researched; but studies on the commuting distance are limited in scope because they usually rely on comparing distances pre- and post-consolidation—which may exaggerate the consolidation’s effect. In this study, optimization approaches are used to decompose school commuting distances at Yanqing, Beijing, based on survey data. The costs of long-distance school commuting as a result of consolidation are estimated after decomposing the effects of school districting, school location and financial stimulation. The findings indicate that these factors contribute significantly to pupils’ long travel distance, and the negative effect of consolidation on school size standardization is exaggerated. These results imply that long-distance school commuting should not be the rationale for a suspension of the central government’s consolidation policy.}, number={2}, journal={Applied Spatial Analysis and Policy}, author={Dai, Te-qi and Wang, Liang and Zhang, Yu-chao and Liao, Cong and Liu, Zheng-bing}, year={2019}, month={Jun}, pages={191–204} }

This paper sheds light on the transport-education inequality nexus with reference to school accessibility by public transport in the {SPMR}. To assess school accessibility, we develop an accessibility index which combines information on the spatial distribution of adolescents, the location of existing schools, and the public transport provision serving the school catchment area into a single measure. The index is used to measure school accessibility locally across 633 areas within the {SPMR}. We use the index to simulate the impact of a policy aiming at increasing the centralisation of public secondary education provision, and ﬁnd that it negatively aﬀects public transport accessibility for students with the lowest levels of accessibility. These results illustrate how existing inequalities can be ampliﬁed by variable accessibility to schools across income groups and geographical space. The research suggests that educational inequality impacts of school agglomeration policies should be considered before centralisation takes place.},

In order to achieve this goal, the potential quotient index has been used, taking into account both the demand for educational services operationalised with the population aged 15–19, and the supply of services depicted by the supply of places for pupils in different types of upper secondary school. A supplementary objective is to present recommendations for transport and educational policy implemented in the city in the context of potential locations of new upper secondary schools based on, among other parameters, the mean centre of the potential accessibility distribution and the potential accessibility dispersion index. We conclude that to better balance access to different types of schools throughout the city in the future, a new location for a general upper secondary school could be considered in the southern or eastern parts of Kraków.}, number={1}, journal={Moravian Geographical Reports}, author={Rosik, Piotr and Puławska-Obiedowska, Sabina and Goliszek, Sławomir}, year={2021}, month={Mar}, pages={15–26} }

The effects of consolidation on the educational quality and the economies of scale have been well researched; but studies on the commuting distance are limited in scope because they usually rely on comparing distances pre- and post-consolidation—which may exaggerate the consolidation’s effect. In this study, optimization approaches are used to decompose school commuting distances at Yanqing, Beijing, based on survey data. The costs of long-distance school commuting as a result of consolidation are estimated after decomposing the effects of school districting, school location and financial stimulation. The findings indicate that these factors contribute significantly to pupils’ long travel distance, and the negative effect of consolidation on school size standardization is exaggerated. These results imply that long-distance school commuting should not be the rationale for a suspension of the central government’s consolidation policy.}, number={2}, journal={Applied Spatial Analysis and Policy}, author={Dai, Te-qi and Wang, Liang and Zhang, Yu-chao and Liao, Cong and Liu, Zheng-bing}, year={2019}, month={Jun}, pages={191–204} }

  abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings: Transportation equity research addresses questions of participation and planning process or the distribution of transportation’s benefits and burdens. This work largely elides issues related to youth and student travel. Existing work on school trip mode choice does not engage deeply with the equity implications of its findings. Education equity researchers identify the abstract notion of choice as equity enhancing but do not engage with the realities of disparate transportation resources and infrastructure. In this review essay, we articulate the contours of transportation equity, youth travel, and school choice research. We use emerging perspectives on “mobility justice” to frame the issues and provide vocabulary that can help bring education and transportation together in planners’ everyday work. Takeaway for practice: A mobility justice framework encourages critical thought and action to address the root causes of inequities. Our conclusions make three contributions to research and practice: 1) challenging school district leaders to think about choice systems designed for access to schools, not just access to information about available options; 2) clarifying the broader implications of school choice by refusing to look away from the racial implications of forecasts; and 3) elucidating the need for a regional perspective.},

The floating catchment area (FCA) method defines the service area of physicians by a threshold travel time while accounting for the availability of physicians by their surrounded demands. The gravity-based method considers a nearby physician more accessible than a remote one and discounts a physician's availability by a gravity-based potential. The former is a special case of the latter. Based on the 2000 Census and primary care physician data, this research assesses the variation of spatial accessibility to primary care in the Chicago region, and analyzes the sensitivity of results by experimenting with ranges of threshold travel times in the FCA method and travel friction coefficients in the gravity model. The methods may be used to help the US Department of Health and Human Services and state health departments improve designation of Health Professional Shortage Areas.},

  abstract = {Studies that examine spatial characteristics of urban unemployment are often based on some simplistic measures of employment accessibility. In this paper a refined methodological framework for measuring accessibility is presented, which enables the researcher (1) to improve the measurement by accounting for job competition among workers commuting by different modes, and (2) to understand the outcome more thoroughly by distinguishing the effect of location from that of workers' auto ownership. This refined framework is applied to a case study of employment accessibility of low-wage workers living in Boston's inner-city neighborhoods, with primarily 1990 Census demographic and journey-to-work data. The empirical results show clearly that, although the central location of inner-city residence still gives the low-wage workers some advantage, auto ownership is the more important determinant. Low-wage workers living in inner-city neighborhoods on average do not have high employment accessibility because a large percentage of them do not own any motor vehicle and hence have limited spatial mobility. Implications of the findings are discussed and qualified in light of the limitation of the research.},

We simulate the Well-to-Wheel energy consumption and GHG emissions of eight transit buses and passenger car powertrains. Vehicles are simulated under three generalized North American operating contexts (450 operating scenarios) using Autonomie and the GREET database. All technologies are normalized by passenger-service-mode-trip-km-travelled GHG emissions to facilitate equivalent comparison. The results indicate that all simulated mobility solutions carry a large variability; however, the most environmentally competitive solutions are fuel cell electric car-share, battery electric car-share, and battery-electric bus, all powered by low-carbon intensity power sources at average occupancy (0.23–19.7 g CO2e passenger-service-mode-trip-km-travelled-1). Furthermore, transit bus technologies have the potential to reduce up to 2.3 times more GHG per passenger-trip than comparable ride-share technologies. Overall, this paper defines occupancy GHG emission thresholds for mobility solutions to inform environmental decision-making processes.},

	abstract = {One of the most common applications of accessibility is in evaluating inequality in access to jobs. A vital factor to be incorporated by accessibility indicators when analyzing job accessibility is the competition for job positions by job seekers; otherwise, the results may be inaccurate or misleading. Despite efforts by researchers to develop accessibility measures that capture job competition, they fail to ensure that these measures are practical and easily interpretable and communicable, which in turn makes planners and policymakers continue to opt for more straightforward measures. In this paper we aim to fill this gap by providing a simple accessibility measure that accounts for competition effects, while remaining practical, intuitive, and highly communicable. The proposed indicator – Balancing Time – is applied to assess the inequality in job accessibility in 160 neighborhoods within the city of Rio de Janeiro, and the results are compared with the most popular indicator used in practice, the cumulative opportunities. The findings suggest that Balancing Time overcomes some of the limitations of cumulative opportunities and that it is a useful tool for planners, particularly in the cities with job opportunities concentrated in central areas. Given its simplicity, Balancing Time is especially relevant in the context of the Global South, where most transport agencies face data limitations and have low skilled technical staff.},

  abstract = {Active school travel (AST) is promoted in many jurisdictions, including Ontario, Canada, where there is provincial support for school travel planning (STP) efforts. Two pillars of school travel plans in the province are education and encouragement. For these pillars to stand, relevant stakeholders must be cognizant of and understand the issues and stakes. For this reason, we deem it important to understand how AST is communicated. In this research we adopt framing analysis to investigate the ways in which various organizations communicate to the public around AST. A frame is a central organizing idea or story line that provides meaning to a particular phenomenon, and thus helps to set the parameters for conversations about policy. In the case of AST, framing can influence what policy alternatives are perceived as available by children, parents, and their wider communities. The research is supported by natural language processing techniques applied to publicly available documents from Ontario stakeholders involved in school travel planning. We then compare the findings from these documents to a selection of academic studies on AST. We conclude that framing of AST in Ontario is mostly empirical-scientific in style, and largely in agreement with academic research on AST. However, it is essentially conservative and does not challenge the status quo of motorized travel. Furthermore, the frames tend to download responsibility for change to households, which limits the scope of policy alternatives by keeping collective action out of the frame.},

   abstract = {As accessibility becomes an increasingly relevant concept in the analysis of sustainable transport and urban development, the accuracy of accessibility measures becomes increasingly vital. While more complex measures are gradually gaining popularity with increasing data and computational resources, policy makers and planners are still prone to opt for less complex methods that are easy to use and interpret. The cumulative opportunities measure is the most widely applied accessibility measure in planning practice, but it is also among the least accurate due to its lack of consideration of the impact of competition for those opportunities. This study seeks to highlight the impact of addressing competition for different urban services in the cumulative opportunities measure. A competition component is added to the measure, which is applied to a case study of three types of urban services in the Perth metropolitan area; health, primary/secondary education and shopping. The results show that considering competition changes the spatial patterns of accessibility and its equity. Since this approach reveals demand-supply imbalances, it can more accurately determine spatial inequalities in accessibility, and hence increases the utility of the cumulative opportunities measure. We also find that the three services had varying levels and spatial patterns of accessibility and spatial equity, thus relying on any single one of them for assessing spatial structural performance can be misleading.},

	abstract = {Conventional integral measures of accessibility, although valuable as indicators of place accessibility, have several limitations when used to evaluate individual accessibility. Two alternatives for overcoming some of the difficulties involved are explored in this study. One is to adapt these measures for evaluating individual accessibility using a disaggregate, nonzonal approach. The other is to develop different types of measures based on an alternative conceptual framework. To pursue the former alternative, this study specifies and examines eighteen gravity-type and cumulative-opportunity accessibility measures using a point-based spatial framework. For the latter option, twelve space-time accessibility measures are developed based on the construct of a prism-constrained feasible opportunity set. This paper compares the relationships and spatial patterns of these thirty measures using network-based GIS procedures. Travel diary data collected in Columbus, Ohio, and a digital data set of 10,727 selected land parcels are used for all computation. Results of this study indicate that space-time and integral indices are distinctive types of accessibility measures which reflect different dimensions of the accessibility experience of individuals. Since space-time measures are more capable of capturing interpersonal differences, especially the effect of space-time constraints, they are more “gender sensitive” and helpful for unraveling gender/ethnic differences in accessibility. An important methodological implication is that whether accessibility is observed to be important or different between individuals depends heavily on whether the measure used is capable of revealing the kind of differences the analyst intends to observe.},

   abstract = {Accessibility is a concept of continuing relevance in transportation research. A number of different measures of accessibility, defined as the potential to reach spatially dispersed opportunities, have been proposed in the literature, and used to address various substantive planning and policy questions. Our objective in this paper is to conduct a review of various commonly used measures of accessibility, with a particular view to clarifying their normative (i.e. prescriptive), as well as positive (i.e. descriptive) aspects. This is a distinction that has seldom been made in the literature and that helps to better understand the meaning of alternative ways to implement the concept of accessibility. Our discussion of the positive and normative aspects of accessibility measurements is illustrated using the city of Montreal, Canada, as a case study. The example highlights the differences in the measured levels of accessibility depending on implementation. Comparison of the two by means of a relative indicator of accessibility helps to identify the gap between desired (as normative defined) and actual (as revealed) accessibility levels.

	abstract = {The evaluation of social impacts of transport policies has been attracting growing attention in recent years. Yet studies thus far have predominately focused on developed countries and overlooked whether equity assessment of transport projects is sensitive to the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). This paper investigates how investments in public transport can reshape socio-spatial inequalities in access to opportunities, and it examines how MAUP can influence the distributional effects of transport project evaluations. The study looks at Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and the transformations carried out in the city in preparation for the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics, which involved substantial expansion in public transport infrastructure followed by cuts in service levels. The paper uses before-and-after comparison of Rio's transport network (2014-2017) and quasi-counterfactual analysis to examine how those policies affect access to schools and jobs for different income groups and whether the results are robust when the data is analyzed at different spatial scales and zoning schemes. Results show that subsequent cuts in service levels have offset the accessibility benefits of transport investments in a way that particularly penalizes the poor, and that those investments alone would still have generated larger accessibility gains for higher-income groups. These findings suggest that, contrary to Brazil’s official discourse of transport legacy, recent policies in Rio have exacerbated rather than reduced socio-spatial inequalities in access to opportunities. The study also shows that MAUP can influence the equity assessment of transport projects, suggesting that this issue should be addressed in future research.},

	abstract = {Accessibility plays a fundamental role in the transport network. In fact, accessibility may be used for investigating the (un)even distribution of economic activities, or the (dis)equilibrium in the development of different regional performances. In particular, accessibility analysis can be considered as a first exploratory step in the understanding of people's needs and behaviour, especially in the framework of transport network structures. From the methodological viewpoint, accessibility has a long tradition, starting in the 1950's with the pioneering work by Hansen, who defined accessibility as the potential of opportunity for interaction. Such a definition can also be considered as an integrated framework of all subsequent definitions. The aim of this paper is to explore accessibility in the German commuting network, by focusing attention on the relevance of the impedance form associated with it. The conventional (potential) accessibility function - in the light of the related economic activities - is used as a suitable instrument to identify the major German hub/attraction nodes. In this formulation, different types of decay functions are used as impedance forms. In our applications we consider home-to-work commuters travelling between 439 German districts, for both 2003 and 2007. We carry out a comparative analysis of the accessibility values in these years, by outlining the different emerging hierarchies, resulting from the use of different impedance forms. In addition, we explore which type of accessibility indicator best matches the connectivity network. The final aim is to identify - by means of different accessibility functions - homogeneous vs. heterogeneous characteristics of the German commuting network.},

By employing the bibliometric analysis techniques, this study provides the potential to trace historical and geographic trends at global level, covering leading journals and institutions, keywords characteristics, citation network analysis, and a qualitative review of the most inﬂuential papers. The output results show that there is an increasing geographic spread along with the growth spurt of research publications on the topic of accessibility especially since 2010s.

We investigate one methodological issue, aggregation error, as it relates to the measurement of {NSA}. Aggregation error arises when, for the purpose of distance calculations, a single point is used to represent a neighbourhood, which in turn represents an aggregation of spatially distributed individuals. {NSA} to three types of recreational amenities (playgrounds, community halls, and leisure centres) in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada is used to assess whether aggregation error affects {NSA} measures. The authors use exploratory spatial data analysis techniques, including local indicators of spatial association, to examine aggregation-error effects on {NSA}. By integrating finer resolution data into {NSA} measures, we demonstrate that aggregation error does affect {NSA} indicators, but that the effect depends on the type of amenity under investigation. Aggregation error is particularly problematic when measuring {NSA} to amenities that are abundant and have highly localized service areas, such as playgrounds. We recommend that, when analyzing {NSA} to these types of amenities, researchers integrate finer resolution data to indicate the spatial distribution of individuals within neighbourhoods better, and hence reduce aggregation error.},

	abstract = {Conventional integral measures of accessibility, although valuable as indicators of place accessibility, have several limitations when used to evaluate individual accessibility. Two alternatives for overcoming some of the difficulties involved are explored in this study. One is to adapt these measures for evaluating individual accessibility using a disaggregate, nonzonal approach. The other is to develop different types of measures based on an alternative conceptual framework. To pursue the former alternative, this study specifies and examines eighteen gravity-type and cumulative-opportunity accessibility measures using a point-based spatial framework. For the latter option, twelve space-time accessibility measures are developed based on the construct of a prism-constrained feasible opportunity set. This paper compares the relationships and spatial patterns of these thirty measures using network-based {GIS} procedures. Travel diary data collected in Columbus, Ohio, and a digital data set of 10,727 selected land parcels are used for all computation. Results of this study indicate that space-time and integral indices are distinctive types of accessibility measures which reflect different dimensions of the accessibility experience of individuals. Since space-time measures are more capable of capturing interpersonal differences, especially the effect of space-time constraints, they are more “gender sensitive” and helpful for unraveling gender/ethnic differences in accessibility. An important methodological implication is that whether accessibility is observed to be important or different between individuals depends heavily on whether the measure used is capable of revealing the kind of differences the analyst intends to observe.},

This study takes advantage of increasingly available land parcel and business establishment data to analyze how the measurement of proximity to urban services or amenities performed in many fields can be impacted by using these data—which can be considered “individual” when compared to aggregated origins or destinations. We use business establishment data across five distinctive {US} cities: Long Beach, Irvine, and Moreno Valley in California; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and the New York borough of Staten Island. In these case studies, we show how aggregation error, a previously recognized concern in using census-type data, can be minimized through careful choice of distance measures. Informed by these regions, we provide recommendations for researchers evaluating the potential risks of a measurement strategy that differs from the “gold standard” of network distance from individually measured, point-based origins and destinations. We find limited support for previous hypotheses regarding measurement error based on the abundance or clustering of urban services or amenities, though further research is merited. Importantly, these new data sources reveal vast differences across cities, underscoring how accurate proximity measurement necessitates a critical understanding of the nuances of the urban landscape under investigation as measures appear heavily influenced by a city’s street layouts and historical development trajectories.},

In consequence of the progressive urban-based centralization of health care facilities and specialized personnel encouraged by the desire to take advantage of economies of scale in supply, the role of the general practitioner within rural health care delivery has become increasingly crucial. However, the supply of general practitioners in rural areas has not kept pace with demands, and accessibility to physicians has become a pressing issue in many rural areas. Although ‘accessibility’ is not taken to be synonymous with physical or geographical accessibility, the dispersed settlement characteristic of most rural areas elevates the latter to a position of primary importance. Following a discussion of the merits of measures of accessibility based upon utilization versus measures based upon the relative location of population and physicians, a measure on potential physical accessibility is presented and applied to a Canadian data set. The results Suggest that although considerable differences in potential accessibility exist between rural areas near and far from urban centres, the smaller catchment populations of most rural general practitioners may partly compensate for isolation from major, urban concentrations of physicians.},

Measuring the spatial accessibility to urban parks serves as an initial step in urban planning and devel­ oping urban development strategies to improve social and environmental justice. This study aims to evaluate measures of spatial accessibility to urban parks by comparing three geographic information systems (GIS)-based approaches, accounting for network complexity, transport modes, distance thresholds, and destination choices. Taking Ipswich City (Australia) and Enschede (the Netherlands) as two testbeds, we examine the spatial patterns of a total of 21 accessibility measures in the two cities and conduct a correlation and principal component analysis to unravel the interrelationship between these measures. The results suggest that among all measures under the three approaches, the selection of distance thresholds and transport modes matter more to accessibility measures than the destination choices. Furthermore, when distance threshold and transport mode are held constant, the network-based and entrance-based methods provide more realistic accessibility measures than other methods. We also discuss the generality of the entrance-based method we propose and suggest ways to choose the most appropriate accessibility measure for use in different contexts.},

  abstract = {Low-carbon travel of urban residents is an important issue of public concern for sustainable development of global cities under climate change. The carbon emissions generated by school trips occupy a significant pro­ portion of the carbon emissions of people’s travel and are increasing year by year. In this paper, we review the progress in research on carbon emissions generated by school trips, the socio-spatial differences in school trips, and the influence mechanisms and optimization simulations of carbon emissions from school trips. Two major dilemmas are observed in the human-environment relationship of low-carbon school trips. First, the dramatic reconstruction of social space in cities and the imbalanced development of public service supply in the rapid urbanization process have led to the socio-spatial heterogeneity of the complex environment of school trips, thus making it difficult to form an effective model of governance of urban space that is conducive to low-carbon school trips. Second, the interaction mechanisms related to school trips remain unclear due to the dynamic and multi-scale nature of the geographic environment, which hinders a clear description of the effects of the built environment on low-carbon school trips and the in-depth simulation of the optimization path. Therefore, in future research, researchers should focus on multi-paradigm crossover and fusion, carry out prospective explo­ ration on the human-environment interactions associated with low-carbon school trips, enrich the research methods of human-environment relationship, discuss the mechanisms of the complete built environment on lowcarbon school trips, simulate the spatial nested structure and refine the governance model to meet the needs for low-carbon school trips.},

These connections may shape the city structure, access to opportunities and the outcome of policies addressing each market separately. To study the consequences of these connections, I develop a quantitative spatial model that incorporates school choice. Parents with diﬀerent skills select their residence by balancing access to schools and employment, choose a school considering its endogenous peer composition, and compete with childless households for houses and jobs. I use data from Madrid on school admissions and workers’ commuting trips to estimate preferences for schools and workplaces. Combining households’ location data with exogenous variation from the city’s historical expansion, I estimate neighborhood preferences separately from endogenous school quality. I ﬁnd that school access inﬂuences residential and job choices, decreasing segregation across parents by 15\% and shifting workers towards productive areas. However, the opposite relocation of non-parents increases overall segregation. Work commuting costs concentrate skilled households in central locations, increasing school quality diﬀerences for students from high and low-skill families by 2.6\% through peer eﬀects. Finally, I show that interactions between schools and the labor market shape the eﬀects of work-from-home and school transportation policies.},

We collected 8,343 responses through an online survey before the Covid19 pandemic (November/December 2019) from a sample of schools located in the province of Varese (Northwest of Italy). First, the study estimates the home-school commuting {CO}2 emissions from students and school staff of the selected schools, both in the starting scenario and in policy scenarios, inducing different potential shifts from car towards more sustainable transport means. Second, it determines the most relevant factors of transport mode selection for school commuting. The findings show that students at high school, even if their trips are generally longer, have lower {CO}2 emissions than teachers/staff and students of primary and middle schools, because of a higher intensive use of public transport. The optimistic scenario of a 75\% shift from car use to walking, for homeschool distances up to 2 km, and to public transport, for distances between 2 and 10 km, would save a big amount of {CO}2 emissions, included in the range 60–67\%. Travel distance and time are the two most relevant factors, when students and teachers/staff select the transport means for school commuting. The identification of appropriate sustainable transport policies should consider the geographical, urban, and infrastructural charac­ teristics of the place in which each school is located and of the travel routes.},

	abstract = {Place-based accessibility measures communicate the potential interaction with opportunities at a zone that populations can access. Recent research has explored the implications of how opportunities are counted by different accessibility methods. In conventional measures, opportunities are multiply counted if more than one zone offers access to the same opportunity. This multi-count of opportunities leads to values of accessibility that are difficult to interpret. A possible solution to enhance the meaning-making of accessibility results is by constraining the calculations to match a known quantity. This ensures all zonal values sum up to a predetermined quantity (i.e., the total number of opportunities). In this way, each value can be meaningfully related to this total. A recent effort that implements this solution is spatial availability, a singly-constrained accessibility measure. In this paper, we extend spatial availability for use in the case of multiple modes or more generally, heterogeneous population segments with distinct travel behaviors. After deriving a multimodal version of spatial availability, we proceed to illustrate its features using a synthetic example. We then apply it to an empirical example of low emission zones in Madrid, Spain. We conclude with suggestions for future research and its use in evaluating policy interventions.},

We use emerging perspectives on “mobility justice” to frame the issues and provide vocabulary that can help bring education and transportation together in planners’ everyday work. Takeaway for practice: A mobility justice framework encourages critical thought and action to address the root causes of inequities. Our conclusions make three contributions to research and practice: 1) challenging school district leaders to think about choice systems designed for access to schools, not just access to information about available options; 2) clarifying the broader implications of school choice by refusing to look away from the racial implications of forecasts; and 3) elucidating the need for a regional perspective.},

  abstract = {This article synthesizes two GIS-based accessibility measures into one framework, and applies the methods to examining spatial accessibility to primary health care in the Chicago tencounty region. The floating catchment area (FCA) method defines the service area of physicians by a threshold travel time while accounting for the availability of physicians by their surrounded demands. The gravity-based method considers a nearby physician more accessible than a remote one and discounts a physician's availability by a gravity-based potential. The former is a special case of the latter. Based on the 2000 Census and primary care physician data, this research assesses the variation of spatial accessibility to primary care in the Chicago region, and analyzes the sensitivity of results by experimenting with ranges of threshold travel times in the FCA method and travel friction coefficients in the gravity model. The methods may be used to help the US Department of Health and Human Services and state health departments improve designation of Health Professional Shortage Areas.},

  abstract = {Studies that examine spatial characteristics of urban unemployment are often based on some simplistic measures of employment accessibility. In this paper a refined methodological framework for measuring accessibility is presented, which enables the researcher (1) to improve the measurement by accounting for job competition among workers commuting by different modes, and (2) to understand the outcome more thoroughly by distinguishing the effect of location from that of workers' auto ownership. This refined framework is applied to a case study of employment accessibility of low-wage workers living in Boston's inner-city neighborhoods, with primarily 1990 Census demographic and journey-to-work data. The empirical results show clearly that, although the central location of inner-city residence still gives the low-wage workers some advantage, auto ownership is the more important determinant. Low-wage workers living in inner-city neighborhoods on average do not have high employment accessibility because a large percentage of them do not own any motor vehicle and hence have limited spatial mobility. Implications of the findings are discussed and qualified in light of the limitation of the research.},

We simulate the Well-to-Wheel energy consumption and GHG emissions of eight transit buses and passenger car powertrains. Vehicles are simulated under three generalized North American operating contexts (450 operating scenarios) using Autonomie and the GREET database. All technologies are normalized by passenger-service-mode-trip-km-travelled GHG emissions to facilitate equivalent comparison. The results indicate that all simulated mobility solutions carry a large variability; however, the most environmentally competitive solutions are fuel cell electric car-share, battery electric car-share, and battery-electric bus, all powered by low-carbon intensity power sources at average occupancy (0.23–19.7 g CO2e passenger-service-mode-trip-km-travelled-1). Furthermore, transit bus technologies have the potential to reduce up to 2.3 times more GHG per passenger-trip than comparable ride-share technologies. Overall, this paper defines occupancy GHG emission thresholds for mobility solutions to inform environmental decision-making processes.},

	abstract = {One of the most common applications of accessibility is in evaluating inequality in access to jobs. A vital factor to be incorporated by accessibility indicators when analyzing job accessibility is the competition for job positions by job seekers; otherwise, the results may be inaccurate or misleading. Despite efforts by researchers to develop accessibility measures that capture job competition, they fail to ensure that these measures are practical and easily interpretable and communicable, which in turn makes planners and policymakers continue to opt for more straightforward measures. In this paper we aim to fill this gap by providing a simple accessibility measure that accounts for competition effects, while remaining practical, intuitive, and highly communicable. The proposed indicator – Balancing Time – is applied to assess the inequality in job accessibility in 160 neighborhoods within the city of Rio de Janeiro, and the results are compared with the most popular indicator used in practice, the cumulative opportunities. The findings suggest that Balancing Time overcomes some of the limitations of cumulative opportunities and that it is a useful tool for planners, particularly in the cities with job opportunities concentrated in central areas. Given its simplicity, Balancing Time is especially relevant in the context of the Global South, where most transport agencies face data limitations and have low skilled technical staff.},

   abstract = {As accessibility becomes an increasingly relevant concept in the analysis of sustainable transport and urban development, the accuracy of accessibility measures becomes increasingly vital. While more complex measures are gradually gaining popularity with increasing data and computational resources, policy makers and planners are still prone to opt for less complex methods that are easy to use and interpret. The cumulative opportunities measure is the most widely applied accessibility measure in planning practice, but it is also among the least accurate due to its lack of consideration of the impact of competition for those opportunities. This study seeks to highlight the impact of addressing competition for different urban services in the cumulative opportunities measure. A competition component is added to the measure, which is applied to a case study of three types of urban services in the Perth metropolitan area; health, primary/secondary education and shopping. The results show that considering competition changes the spatial patterns of accessibility and its equity. Since this approach reveals demand-supply imbalances, it can more accurately determine spatial inequalities in accessibility, and hence increases the utility of the cumulative opportunities measure. We also find that the three services had varying levels and spatial patterns of accessibility and spatial equity, thus relying on any single one of them for assessing spatial structural performance can be misleading.},

	abstract = {Conventional integral measures of accessibility, although valuable as indicators of place accessibility, have several limitations when used to evaluate individual accessibility. Two alternatives for overcoming some of the difficulties involved are explored in this study. One is to adapt these measures for evaluating individual accessibility using a disaggregate, nonzonal approach. The other is to develop different types of measures based on an alternative conceptual framework. To pursue the former alternative, this study specifies and examines eighteen gravity-type and cumulative-opportunity accessibility measures using a point-based spatial framework. For the latter option, twelve space-time accessibility measures are developed based on the construct of a prism-constrained feasible opportunity set. This paper compares the relationships and spatial patterns of these thirty measures using network-based GIS procedures. Travel diary data collected in Columbus, Ohio, and a digital data set of 10,727 selected land parcels are used for all computation. Results of this study indicate that space-time and integral indices are distinctive types of accessibility measures which reflect different dimensions of the accessibility experience of individuals. Since space-time measures are more capable of capturing interpersonal differences, especially the effect of space-time constraints, they are more “gender sensitive” and helpful for unraveling gender/ethnic differences in accessibility. An important methodological implication is that whether accessibility is observed to be important or different between individuals depends heavily on whether the measure used is capable of revealing the kind of differences the analyst intends to observe.},

   abstract = {Accessibility is a concept of continuing relevance in transportation research. A number of different measures of accessibility, defined as the potential to reach spatially dispersed opportunities, have been proposed in the literature, and used to address various substantive planning and policy questions. Our objective in this paper is to conduct a review of various commonly used measures of accessibility, with a particular view to clarifying their normative (i.e. prescriptive), as well as positive (i.e. descriptive) aspects. This is a distinction that has seldom been made in the literature and that helps to better understand the meaning of alternative ways to implement the concept of accessibility. Our discussion of the positive and normative aspects of accessibility measurements is illustrated using the city of Montreal, Canada, as a case study. The example highlights the differences in the measured levels of accessibility depending on implementation. Comparison of the two by means of a relative indicator of accessibility helps to identify the gap between desired (as normative defined) and actual (as revealed) accessibility levels.

	abstract = {The evaluation of social impacts of transport policies has been attracting growing attention in recent years. Yet studies thus far have predominately focused on developed countries and overlooked whether equity assessment of transport projects is sensitive to the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). This paper investigates how investments in public transport can reshape socio-spatial inequalities in access to opportunities, and it examines how MAUP can influence the distributional effects of transport project evaluations. The study looks at Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and the transformations carried out in the city in preparation for the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics, which involved substantial expansion in public transport infrastructure followed by cuts in service levels. The paper uses before-and-after comparison of Rio's transport network (2014-2017) and quasi-counterfactual analysis to examine how those policies affect access to schools and jobs for different income groups and whether the results are robust when the data is analyzed at different spatial scales and zoning schemes. Results show that subsequent cuts in service levels have offset the accessibility benefits of transport investments in a way that particularly penalizes the poor, and that those investments alone would still have generated larger accessibility gains for higher-income groups. These findings suggest that, contrary to Brazil’s official discourse of transport legacy, recent policies in Rio have exacerbated rather than reduced socio-spatial inequalities in access to opportunities. The study also shows that MAUP can influence the equity assessment of transport projects, suggesting that this issue should be addressed in future research.},

	abstract = {Accessibility plays a fundamental role in the transport network. In fact, accessibility may be used for investigating the (un)even distribution of economic activities, or the (dis)equilibrium in the development of different regional performances. In particular, accessibility analysis can be considered as a first exploratory step in the understanding of people's needs and behaviour, especially in the framework of transport network structures. From the methodological viewpoint, accessibility has a long tradition, starting in the 1950's with the pioneering work by Hansen, who defined accessibility as the potential of opportunity for interaction. Such a definition can also be considered as an integrated framework of all subsequent definitions. The aim of this paper is to explore accessibility in the German commuting network, by focusing attention on the relevance of the impedance form associated with it. The conventional (potential) accessibility function - in the light of the related economic activities - is used as a suitable instrument to identify the major German hub/attraction nodes. In this formulation, different types of decay functions are used as impedance forms. In our applications we consider home-to-work commuters travelling between 439 German districts, for both 2003 and 2007. We carry out a comparative analysis of the accessibility values in these years, by outlining the different emerging hierarchies, resulting from the use of different impedance forms. In addition, we explore which type of accessibility indicator best matches the connectivity network. The final aim is to identify - by means of different accessibility functions - homogeneous vs. heterogeneous characteristics of the German commuting network.},

However, none of them presents a comprehensive and quantitative overview on accessibility-related publications. To ﬁll this gap, this study reviewed two decades of publications (during 2000–2019) drawn from Web of Science (WoS), and aims to ﬁgure out the evolution pathway of accessibility related studies so that future research directions can be recognized. By employing the bibliometric analysis techniques, this study provides the potential to trace historical and geographic trends at global level, covering leading journals and institutions, keywords characteristics, citation network analysis, and a qualitative review of the most inﬂuential papers. The output results show that there is an increasing geographic spread along with the growth spurt of research publications on the topic of accessibility especially since 2010s. Both the keywords' characteristics and citation network analysis help to identify research hot points, categorized as new indicators development and accessibility-based applications. Finally, this paper highlights the need for further studies for those two hot points respectively. It is hoped the results output here could beneﬁt researchers engaging in this ﬁeld to sharpen their own future research directions, and provide practitioners with a greater understanding of the various types of accessibility metrics and help them to identify the most appropriate practice for their speciﬁc situation.},

Measuring the spatial accessibility to urban parks serves as an initial step in urban planning and devel­ oping urban development strategies to improve social and environmental justice. This study aims to evaluate measures of spatial accessibility to urban parks by comparing three geographic information systems (GIS)-based approaches, accounting for network complexity, transport modes, distance thresholds, and destination choices. Taking Ipswich City (Australia) and Enschede (the Netherlands) as two testbeds, we examine the spatial patterns of a total of 21 accessibility measures in the two cities and conduct a correlation and principal component analysis to unravel the interrelationship between these measures. The results suggest that among all measures under the three approaches, the selection of distance thresholds and transport modes matter more to accessibility measures than the destination choices. Furthermore, when distance threshold and transport mode are held constant, the network-based and entrance-based methods provide more realistic accessibility measures than other methods. We also discuss the generality of the entrance-based method we propose and suggest ways to choose the most appropriate accessibility measure for use in different contexts.},

  abstract = {Low-carbon travel of urban residents is an important issue of public concern for sustainable development of global cities under climate change. The carbon emissions generated by school trips occupy a significant pro­ portion of the carbon emissions of people’s travel and are increasing year by year. In this paper, we review the progress in research on carbon emissions generated by school trips, the socio-spatial differences in school trips, and the influence mechanisms and optimization simulations of carbon emissions from school trips. Two major dilemmas are observed in the human-environment relationship of low-carbon school trips. First, the dramatic reconstruction of social space in cities and the imbalanced development of public service supply in the rapid urbanization process have led to the socio-spatial heterogeneity of the complex environment of school trips, thus making it difficult to form an effective model of governance of urban space that is conducive to low-carbon school trips. Second, the interaction mechanisms related to school trips remain unclear due to the dynamic and multi-scale nature of the geographic environment, which hinders a clear description of the effects of the built environment on low-carbon school trips and the in-depth simulation of the optimization path. Therefore, in future research, researchers should focus on multi-paradigm crossover and fusion, carry out prospective explo­ ration on the human-environment interactions associated with low-carbon school trips, enrich the research methods of human-environment relationship, discuss the mechanisms of the complete built environment on lowcarbon school trips, simulate the spatial nested structure and refine the governance model to meet the needs for low-carbon school trips.},

This process led to numerous school closures and raised important policy questions regarding the economic value of a school in terms of its capitalization into property values and, by extension, how the closure of a school might affect local neighborhoods. To explore these questions, this research uses spatial hedonic methods to estimate the implicit value of accessibility to schools in the City of Hamilton, Ontario. Spatial Durbin model results provide evidence of a significant negative correlation between distance to schools and housing prices in the Canadian context. This suggests that accessibility to schools is capitalized into property values and that the closure of a neighborhood school may result in potentially significant losses of economic value in communities.},

	abstract = {The location choices of households with children connect housing, labor, and school markets. These connections may shape the city structure, access to opportunities and the outcome of policies addressing each market separately. To study the consequences of these connections, I develop a quantitative spatial model that incorporates school choice. Parents with diﬀerent skills select their residence by balancing access to schools and employment, choose a school considering its endogenous peer composition, and compete with childless households for houses and jobs. I use data from Madrid on school admissions and workers’ commuting trips to estimate preferences for schools and workplaces. Combining households’ location data with exogenous variation from the city’s historical expansion, I estimate neighborhood preferences separately from endogenous school quality. I ﬁnd that school access inﬂuences residential and job choices, decreasing segregation across parents by 15\% and shifting workers towards productive areas. However, the opposite relocation of non-parents increases overall segregation. Work commuting costs concentrate skilled households in central locations, increasing school quality diﬀerences for students from high and low-skill families by 2.6\% through peer eﬀects. Finally, I show that interactions between schools and the labor market shape the eﬀects of work-from-home and school transportation policies.},

We collected 8,343 responses through an online survey before the Covid19 pandemic (November/December 2019) from a sample of schools located in the province of Varese (Northwest of Italy). First, the study estimates the home-school commuting {CO}2 emissions from students and school staff of the selected schools, both in the starting scenario and in policy scenarios, inducing different potential shifts from car towards more sustainable transport means. Second, it determines the most relevant factors of transport mode selection for school commuting. The findings show that students at high school, even if their trips are generally longer, have lower {CO}2 emissions than teachers/staff and students of primary and middle schools, because of a higher intensive use of public transport. The optimistic scenario of a 75\% shift from car use to walking, for homeschool distances up to 2 km, and to public transport, for distances between 2 and 10 km, would save a big amount of {CO}2 emissions, included in the range 60–67\%. Travel distance and time are the two most relevant factors, when students and teachers/staff select the transport means for school commuting. The identification of appropriate sustainable transport policies should consider the geographical, urban, and infrastructural charac­ teristics of the place in which each school is located and of the travel routes.},

	abstract = {Place-based accessibility measures communicate the potential interaction with opportunities at a zone that populations can access. Recent research has explored the implications of how opportunities are counted by different accessibility methods. In conventional measures, opportunities are multiply counted if more than one zone offers access to the same opportunity. This multi-count of opportunities leads to values of accessibility that are difficult to interpret. A possible solution to enhance the meaning-making of accessibility results is by constraining the calculations to match a known quantity. This ensures all zonal values sum up to a predetermined quantity (i.e., the total number of opportunities). In this way, each value can be meaningfully related to this total. A recent effort that implements this solution is spatial availability, a singly-constrained accessibility measure. In this paper, we extend spatial availability for use in the case of multiple modes or more generally, heterogeneous population segments with distinct travel behaviors. After deriving a multimodal version of spatial availability, we proceed to illustrate its features using a synthetic example. We then apply it to an empirical example of low emission zones in Madrid, Spain. We conclude with suggestions for future research and its use in evaluating policy interventions.},
